                <p class="intro">Growing up, tech felt like a foreign language—one spoken by kids with iPads, not boys who borrowed calculators. I wasn’t born into wealth. My background? Think chalkboards, hand-me-downs, and a love for chemistry, not coding.</p>

                <div class="content-section">
                    <h2>The Spark</h2>
                    <p>But something inside wouldn’t let me settle. While others scrolled, I studied. When the world slept, I Googled “how to build a website”. I didn’t know where it would lead—only that I had to try.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-section">
                    <h2>Where I Stand</h2>
                    <p>Now? I’m building, learning, failing, and rising again. The journey isn’t glamorous, but every late night and broken build reminds me:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>"Excellence doesn’t check your background—it responds to persistence."</p>
                    </blockquote>

                <div class="content-section">
                    <h2>The Road Ahead</h2>
                    <p>And the best part? I’m just getting started.</p>
